# Bachelor-Thesis
This is a web application intended to help students @ IBU to view, apply and manage their final thesis with their respective mentor. The application is hosted at http://ibu-sdp.herokuapp.com/.

## Goal
Build an application with different roles and access levels for students, mentors and administrators. Mentors can publish the details of their bachelor and master theses and see the students that applied. Similarly, students can get info about thesis application procedures and deadlines, view and apply for topics. After mentor assigns the topic to student, a management page helps organize meetings and track progress. Administrator can create new roles in the system as well as permissions.
